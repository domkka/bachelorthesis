# Thesis Structure: Reproducibility in Open Educational Technology

## 1. Introduction
- **Purpose**: Introduce the topic and its importance.
- **Content**:
  - Define Open Educational Technology (OET) and its role in education (e.g., open-source tools, platforms like Moodle, or learning analytics systems).
  - Explain reproducibility in the context of educational research and technology (e.g., ability to replicate studies, verify algorithms, or reuse code).
  - State the research problem: Why is reproducibility a challenge in OET?
  - Research questions (e.g., “To what extent are OET studies reproducible?”, “What factors hinder reproducibility in OET?”).
  - Objectives and scope of the thesis.
  - Brief outline of the thesis structure.

## 2. Background and Literature Review
- **Purpose**: Provide context and summarize existing research.
- **Content**:
  - Overview of OET: Key technologies, platforms, and their open-source nature.
  - Reproducibility in scientific research: Definitions, principles, and importance.
  - Challenges to reproducibility in OET (e.g., lack of open data, proprietary algorithms, or incomplete documentation).
  - Review of prior studies on reproducibility in education technology or related fields (e.g., learning analytics, AI in education).
  - Identify gaps in the literature (e.g., limited focus on reproducibility in OET).

## 3. Theoretical Framework
- **Purpose**: Establish the conceptual foundation for your analysis.
- **Content**:
  - Define key concepts: reproducibility, replicability, open science, and open-source software.
  - Discuss frameworks for assessing reproducibility (e.g., FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
  - Propose a model for evaluating reproducibility in OET (e.g., checklist for data, code, and methodology availability).

## 4. Methodology
- **Purpose**: Explain how you will conduct your research.
- **Content**:
  - **Research Design**: Qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods approach (e.g., systematic review of papers combined with reproducibility checks).
  - **Data Collection**:
    - Source of papers (e.g., Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library).
    - Criteria for selecting papers (e.g., focus on OET, published in the last 10 years).
  - **Analysis Method**:
    - Develop a reproducibility checklist (e.g., availability of data, code, detailed methodology, open licenses).
    - Process for reading papers (e.g., extracting text from PDFs using Python).
    - Criteria for assessing reproducibility (e.g., can the study be replicated based on provided materials?).
  - **Tools**: Python for PDF processing, reproducibility evaluation scripts.
  - **Limitations**: Challenges in accessing full-text papers, incomplete metadata, or subjective interpretation of reproducibility.

## 5. Results
- **Purpose**: Present findings from your analysis.
- **Content**:
  - Summary of collected papers (e.g., number of papers, types of OET studied).
  - Reproducibility scores for each paper based on your checklist.
  - Patterns or trends (e.g., are certain types of OET more reproducible?).
  - Examples of highly reproducible vs. non-reproducible studies.
  - Visualizations (e.g., bar charts showing reproducibility metrics).

## 6. Discussion
- **Purpose**: Interpret results and connect to the literature.
- **Content**:
  - Compare findings with prior research on reproducibility.
  - Discuss factors affecting reproducibility in OET (e.g., technical barriers, institutional incentives).
  - Implications for OET developers, educators, and researchers.
  - Recommendations for improving reproducibility (e.g., adopting open science practices, standardizing documentation).

## 7. Conclusion
- **Purpose**: Summarize the thesis and outline future work.
- **Content**:
  - Recap key findings and contributions.
  - Answer research questions.
  - Limitations of the study.
  - Suggestions for future research (e.g., longitudinal studies on reproducibility, developing OET-specific reproducibility guidelines).

## 8. References
- Use a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, IEEE).
- Include all sources cited in the thesis (e.g., papers, books, websites).

## 9. Appendices (Optional)
- Include supplementary materials:
  - Full reproducibility checklist.
  - List of analyzed papers with metadata (e.g., title, authors, DOI).
